# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

My solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code as shiny Jupyter notebooks. The markdown for each day is available in the corresponding notebook. The markdown was extracted with the [aoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/kfarnung/aoc-to-markdown) Chrome extension.

**You can run and interact with the code and the solutions directly from your browser via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/markusschanta/advent-of-code-2022/HEAD).**

    "The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called `/`. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the terminal output, lines that begin with `$` are _commands you executed_, very much like some modern computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `cd` means _change directory_. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:\n",
    "    *   `cd x` moves _in_ one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named `x` and makes it the current directory.\n",
    "    *   `cd ..` moves _out_ one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.\n",
    "    *   `cd /` switches the current directory to the outermost directory, `/`.\n",
    "*   `ls` means _list_. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:\n",
    "    *   `123 abc` means that the current directory contains a file named `abc` with size `123`.\n",
    "    *   `dir xyz` means that the current directory contains a directory named `xyz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the _total size_ of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The total size of directory `e` is _584_ because it contains a single file `i` of size 584 and no other directories.\n",
    "*   The directory `a` has total size _94853_ because it contains files `f` (size 29116), `g` (size 2557), and `h.lst` (size 62596), plus file `i` indirectly (`a` contains `e` which contains `i`).\n",
    "*   Directory `d` has total size _24933642_.\n",
    "*   As the outermost directory, `/` contains every file. Its total size is _48381165_, the sum of the size of every file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of _at most 100000_, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are `a` and `e`; the sum of their total sizes is _`95437`_ (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)\n",
